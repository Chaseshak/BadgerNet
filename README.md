# BadgerNet

BadgerNet is a software that was developed for UW Athletics teams as a platform for coaches
to share information with their athletes and communicate effectively. The current system
works so poorly that most teams have abandoned the tool entirely in favor of easier to use sites
such as SharePoint, Google Docs or just using email. The only team currently using the platform
is the rowing team. Head coach Bebe Bryans continually expresses frustration for the tool since
it is frequently down, causing both athletes and coaches to not have access to crucial material,
and the difficulty of conducting simple tasks such as uploading a document and sending
emails/texts. The athletes on the team also dislike its lack of intuitive interface and the inability
to access most things on a phone. Creating a new BadgerNet would not only streamline the
process for the rowing team, but also have the potential to be used as intended, for multiple D1
teams across campus.
